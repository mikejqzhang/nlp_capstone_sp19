applehelp	RickRussellTX	That's a somewhat strange thing to say; officially the iMac G3/333Mhz supports up to MacOS 10.3. That's a perfectly functional OS if you have the RAM to run it, and I can speak from experience that MacOS 10.2 ran adequately for day-to-day documents and web browsing on a G3/233Mhz.
books	JadedEconomist	The problem you'll have with reading Nietzsche is that his entire body of works is a reaction to over 2000 years of Western philosophical thought. You're not going to understand him whatsoever without having a background understanding of philosophy and, more specifically, a solid understanding of the works that he was specifically reacting to.

It's like they're shocked to the point where they don't know if he did do it or if he didn't. You don't lean to one side or the other, you're just not sure. Like do you think Michael Jackson molested those kids, or do you think he was just weird and liked hanging out with them. You're not really sure, so you have no strong opinion on it.

worldnews	onlyinasick	"&gt;There is no way in which you can effectively block the ""rednecks"" while allowing the rest in, and immigration of this kind is mostly based on humanitarian needs which trump whatever you opinions you have of their culture and beliefs. They are still subject to the laws of the nation they reside in.Having a sound immigration policy, which does not allow rural peasants who were meant to be temporary guest workers stay in the country permanently, would go a long way to blocking out the ""rednecks"".&gt;immigration of this kind is mostly based on humanitarian needs which trump whatever you opinions you have of their culture and beliefsLetting  people from such regions by the hundreds of thousands when it causes crime to sky-rocket, destroys social-cohesion and ends up costing the country billions of dollars in  healthcare, crime and related costs simply because it is for ""humanitarian"" reasons is misguided. You are destroying your own country from the inside out. If you let in a small number, it is okay, but when you let them in, in such a great volume that they drain billions of dollars per year from government coffers and cause disproportionate  amounts of crime and fill up your countries prisons, it  is a misguided policy.  Especially when these people reproduce and in time will constitute millions of generally speaking unproductive and crime prone citizens. An immigration policy based on bringing productive people, not simple manual labourers and ""refugees"" is what is needed. &gt;A single case of this proves absolutely nothing and should not be a basis for opinions. As I have shown this kind of behavior is just as prevalent with non-immigrants as with immigrants, the majority of which do not behave in this manner, even if their beliefs were identical.It says a lot about the culture these ""rednecks"" come from. When you take in the most backward and unintelligent people a country has to offer it has dire consequences. Also lol at just as prevalent among non-immigrants as immigrants. Keep on dreaming son. "

politics	hakzorz	Interesting comment string from Rolling Stone blog&gt;To expand:LaTour Trading was registered as a Foreign LLC in June 2009, with a Delaware Jurisdiction. It's registered agent is listed as Tower Research Capital LLC.&gt;Tower Research Capital is a financial services firm specializing in quantitative trading (ie, that computer trading stuff). Tower Reseach Capital is the financial piggy bank for Mark Gortons other ventures. Tower Research does the pattern analysis based upon tools that Gorton had built after a stint at Credit Suisse Boston, and until recently, most of the trades for TRC went through their affiliate, Lime Brokerage LLC. In June of this year, Lime Brokerage was sold to Wedbush.&gt;Now, interesting thing to note: Latour Trading LLC first appeared on the top 20 Program Trading list the week of Oct 25-29, 2010. This is, coincidentally, the same week that Wedbush completely disappeared from the Top 20 list. At first, I thought it might be a spinoff by Wedbush to separate their HFT activities from their other securities, but both Wedbush and LimeBrokerage have their own DNS. Since this site uses Tower Research Capital as their web DNS, that would mean that this is a spinoff of TRC.&gt;So, the questions I would have are:1) Why do you create a SECOND high frequency trading firm when you already have an established one?2) Why did Wedbush disappear from the Program Trading at exactly the same time that Latour Trading LLC snuck into essentially the same place it had been holding?Reply&gt;And to understand the Wedbush relevance you need to update yourself at deepcapture.com**What ever this is now comes up blank**Reply&gt;So the interesting question is, if you're a quant guy with a trading algorithm and TWO high frequency trading companies, could you utilize them to play off each other and increase your advantage?

books	womanation	Oh, the sequels are just as fascinating and involving.  Don't skip.  Now, time progresses and things change in the Dune universe of course.  But when you get to God Emporer of Dune, you'll realize why you had to read them.  The sequels really are the continuation of the first book in an important way--you find out where things were heading from the start with Dune.  Some book series are just sequels, like the author had to find more to write about.  But with Dune, it's like the whole story was always there, but it wouldn't fit in one book so there had to be 6.  After Chapterhouse Dune, I think its probably worthwhile to read Brian Herbert's next two that finish the series based on his father's notes.  I have never read the prequels or any of the interim sequels by Brian Herbert.  Read Frank Herberts original series in order, then Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune by Brian Herbert if you don't like loose ends.  Then if you want more you can go back to read his son Frank's books that flesh out some of the story lines.  
linux	ProtoDong	No the memory management is fine under all circumstances except one.  When writing to a USB stick.  USB HD transfers are fine probably because the drive has a built in buffer.  The problem is well known with Ubuntu and nautilus.  Speeds can sometimes double by dropping the caches before a USB transfer.  I've searched far and wide and there is no fix other than dropping caches and using the command line.  Rather than fixing that bug Ubuntu simply skipped over it and worked on Unity.

It is just as effective as when being in person when using Spype, because the energy field from the Universe travels to any part of the planet. It does not take Adam Miller being present for the healing process to commence, and will have the same effectiveness from the beginning to the completion of the healing process.

Android	bsoder	"On Friday my coworker came to my desk with a Epic Touch, he was trying to root it and somehow installed the kernel for a different phone.  It would boot up but it wouldn't connect to networks and none of the buttons worked either.I tried to reinstall the correct kernel (the one that was for the phone but rooted), but when it went into recovery, it appeared that somehow the recovery was for the wrong phone as well, because it wouldn't let me press any button there either.  Basically everywhere I went on the phone none of the buttons worked.When I went into ""download mode"", I could push the correct kernel and recovery to the phone using Heimdall, but it didn't seem to work.  I swear I tried it like 3 times and when I booted the phone back up it was still broken.I thought it was definitely bricked, but then I used heimdall to push the default kernel, that wasn't rooted, to the phone, it turned on and everything was back to normal (except I still think he has the wrong recovery version), I gave it back and said I wasn't touching it any further.I definitely was using the term ""bricked"" for half the day that I thought there was no getting it back to a working device.

Day.)The level of weaponization of the NHS in British political rhetoric is flabbergasting. It's said that Social Security (our version of your National Insurance) is the ""third rail"" of American politics—any politician that touches it gets electrocuted—but there is no comparison. I, for one, have no desire whatsoever to ever experience the US equivalent of how in the UK (as /u/Edward_Elgar  noted) the NHS is always, Always, ALWAYS the #1 topic of every single election, with every candidate competing to outdo the others in promising that the NHS will ""always be free"" and that he is the only candidate who can make sure that the local GP's surgery hours will widen and that the A&amp;E will no longer be ""the worst in England"" or ""the second-worst in Yorkshire"".(Canada, also with a single-payer system, sensibly divorces billing from providers. As in the US private entities deliver most healthcare, and in both countries if one's doctor has inconvenient hours or if the local hospital has substandard care, one simply goes to another as opposed to having this being something politicians are expected to fix.)"

If that means borrowing from family/friends than do so, but with debt from student loans, credit card and on top of it a bank loan (if it fails) than you're really in a hole.

videos	bitcloud	"a frying pan would probably be the best weapon I'd have in this house... not so ridiculous it seems...Also, when someone is threatening someone with a weapon and won't back down, firing a gun at them is notorious for being known as THE SINGLE WORST IDEA you could possibly have at that situation. It's PRECISELY why hostage negotiators are brought in - not for the sake of the man with the gun, but for the sake of victims. &gt; if someone is threatening to kill an innocent person and they won't be reasoned with then it's ok to shoot them.If that's the only course of action you can see, you have the *means* to do this, and the circumstances don't mean you're endangering the lives of others by doing this, then by all means.Very different to ""mowing down 20 people holding stones"""
photography	pjeedai	I bought the 70-300mm last week and was pretty disappointed with the quality once over 200mm. Took it back the next day and bought a second hand Sigma 70-200mm 2.8 DG Hsm. World apart in IQ but the auto focus doesn't work so that's going back tomorrow. Currently deciding between the Canon 70-200mm f4 L IS, the 70-200mm f2.8 L IS, the 70-200mm f2.8 L IS II (all second hand but exc++ or mint-). But the thing I found with the sigma was it's a heavy chunk of kit and the f2.8 L models are heavier still. So I'm also looking at the 70-300mm f4.5-6 L which seems to be a decent middle ground for IQ and weight and comes in new around the same price as a 2nd hand f2.8 L IS. Decisions, decisions. I've tried a couple now and I can see the value of the constant aperture and the IS so rather than continue cheaping out I'm seriously considering doubling the budget to get the f2.8 L IS II as it seems to be the best out there. I've just upgraded my nifty fifty to the f1.4 and got the 24mm pancake and I'm delighted with both of those so I want something stellar for the longer end, sports and portrait stuff.

And that is where you pay the extra amount when the game is first released and it gives you a couple immediate bonuses, and the first DLC for free.

To allow 50 states to each come to their own conclusion on whether acts of the federal government are unconstitutional would undermine the purpose of the supremacy clause, which ""reflected the framers anxiety to preserve the Constitution in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State"""

MensRights	ThatCynicalCynicism	The video series is really just a way for Anita to distinguish her propaganda from other Feminists. Her video series has it's own style, looks at a new medium to analyse under a Feminist lens (gaming), and in turn, creates a lot of views and attention for Anita herself.The video series itself is trivial in what it is attempting to do. Although it does serve it's purpose. Both for Anita, and for the MRM. For her, it brings a lot of attention in exchange for doing something incredibly easy. For us, it highlights just how pathetic Feminism has become, making our message look like a breath of sanity to unbiased onlookers. Which is actually the problem we have had for a long time. When most people hear ''Men's Rights'', they think *''er, but, men have always had rights..''*. Hopefully that will change when this debate gets taken to a more mainstream platform. The hype over this video series is bolstering that conversation.

business	silverwater	&gt; I feel the same way about your arguments, but I still try to respond to the content of your arguments rather than my assumptions about them.You're right, I went ad hominem. Apologies.&gt; Then I guess we have fundamentally different ideas about what is freedom and what is not. You seem to think that forcing someone to negotiate with a party, against their will, is not a violation of any of their rights.We have the same goal, and that's to have a society that results the maximum quality of life for the most amount of people. However, being a pragmatist, this is where I usually fail to find common ground with the libertarian view point.What should be a right and what should be restricted by law is totally subjective. So since any law can be seen as a violation of someone's rights, the argument that a law is wrong simply because it does so is invalid. To me a  demonstration that the benefits outweigh the costs is a more powerful argument, though it should probably be shown that there is a significant margin between the two, otherwise I'd have to air on the side of individual rights.We don't have the right to advertise sugar pills as a cure for cancer, we don't have the right to drive our cars after 10 beers, we don't the right to sit on a park bench and start masturbating...we don't have these rights because the cost to our society is greater than the benefits (maybe these aren't the greatest examples but you get the idea).So as for making an employer send a couple representatives to a bargaining table being a violation of their rights, yes it is, but this is such a small cost compared to the benefit of diminishing the chance of work stoppages that have a rippling effect on the economy and the resulting unrest created when people feel like they have no hope [(read the introduction to the NLRA)](https://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act) I'd also argue that the NLRA protects more rights than it takes away - mainly the rights of free association and speech.I could raise the issues of unions contributing to a more democratic and socially just society, but I'm guessing that'd fall on deaf ears. In general though, I think you give the idea of a union too much credit. Do you know how hard it is to get colleagues to start seeing one another as having shared interests? It ain't easy, that's for sure.&gt; The solution is to let the process of economic development run its course until child labor is not necessary.You may very well be right about this, but a child working a mundane job instead of building their mind, diminishes the life of one not strong enough yet to determine their own course, is just so terribly wrong. So I just have a hard time accepting this, especially living in a world where there is such with such a huge wealth disparity.  &gt; A union is not a self-interested party. A union represents self-interested parties, who are not directly affected by the destruction of their industry 30 years into the future, since they would have retired by then.Unions are generally made up of the socially conscious type - no one gets into organizing for the money. I can't say for certain if this challenges your point, however I don't exactly see the difference between the unionist who is going to retire and the CEO is going to retire and the shareholders who can pull out when put their money elsewhere when it suits them.&gt; Many of the laws and union-backed agreements that ended up destroying many of America's industries took decades to have their full effect. It wasn't a case of a law being passed, and the next year, the industry going bankrupt.Examples needed where the industries were actually bankrupted, not just moved overseas to increase profits because workers will settle for less.&gt; Why should employers pay out the most they can afford, and why should laws be passed to force employers to do so?The only reason people invest is to profit. If all profits had to be paid to employees, there would be no incentive to invest, and therefore no increase in capital/productivity.I never said that employers should be paying out all they can afford, and you setting up this straw man only reiterates my point that these discussions with libertarian types all too often come down to this zero-sum game, where an increase in working conditions will trigger bankruptcy, which I think stems from a belief that supply-side economics is keeping standards the highest they can possibly be.If a company has an operating income of $1 bil, what is giving a 5% pay raise to workers going to do, except make that operating income slightly less? I suppose it'd be better if that money were invested back into the company...but wait, aren't people a resource to invest in? And one that offers a high rate of return?Take the the lock-out of ConEd workers in NYC for example: ConEd's profits were over 2 billion when their previous contract was signed, and a few years later when their contract expired the profits were still that high. What did ConEd do? They came to the table with an offer that slashed their benefits tremendously, and locked-out all the workers when the union rejected it. How can the case be made that ConEd couldn't afford to give workers what they already had? Has their value all of a sudden dropped? I don't think so. This is just greed, and doesn't contribute to a healthy society.

atheism	fwipfwip	"Yes, entirely serious. I did mention that experiments are verified. Newtonian physics are experienced, not tested every single day. Sure, student labs do testing on this all the time, but not all people do.Quantum mechanics is an engineering model for how sub-atomic physics works. Effects like electron-tunnelling are explained away as ""magic"". The Bohr model of the atom was vindicated when electron tunnelling microscopes were invented because scientists weren't entirely sure the model was true until they saw a picture.As you said, you *could* go out and verify scientific experiments. But, you don't have the time in a human life to go out and actually conduct them all. You accept that the theorems and ideas that preceded you are true largely on the word of older scientists and teachers that came before you.I'm not arguing that religion is the correct world view to take. I'm entirely atheistic and a scientist myself. But, you cannot take the entire body of science and say, ""Well, we conducted some experiments and they match this portion of this science textbook therefore by induction all of science is correct."" In fact, this is the antithesis of science because science is meant to evolve i.e. Relativity displacing Classical Mechanics. I'm well aware of the scientific method and this is more of the problem. You do not. If you were aware of how it worked you'd understand that science is not about what's real, it's about modeling the behavior of the world in testable ways. That is, until someone finds a better model and closer fit to behavior.Let's take this another way. When Einstein came up with Relativity he reportedly got immense black-lash from the scientific community. He was dead wrong they said, he had erred. It took a long time for the community to come around because of ... wait for it .... belief. There is a strong urge in human nature to form a notion of what the world is and can be. Science implicitly disturbs peoples' view of the way the world works as a function of just being science. Change is hard to accept and the reason for that is people *believe* in what they were taught. If it was as simple as conducting experiments then it would be child's play to move the status quo, but:1. Not everyone can conduct the experiments2. Not everyone trusts the authenticity of the experimenters3. Not everyone is ready to accept the implications of experimentsJust look at yourself. You believe I'm full of it and yet you didn't refute a single point I made. You said this:1. Some things are testable frequently2. CERN did some stuff, still didn't break speed of light3. Hey you could test some stuff in your house4. Induction, all science is correct5. Nothing in Bible is testableIf there is any fact that you yourself have not tested then it is equivalent to a story told to you from a religious text. You trust the messenger and give them credibility. That is the basis of equivalence. You can test some things, but not enough in a human lifetime to vindicate much of what's been done in the realm of physics. Even if you did and told others, they'd have to believe in you and trust you.Let me distill the philosophical equivalence further: Prove the existence of knowledge. Here's a hint, you cannot."

Economics	TheNicestMonkey	I dont' think its irrelevant at all. The actions of city councils have a variety of effects on housing prices in different parts of the city or in the city as a whole. The building of a park can raise prices, an increase of taxes can drive out high income workers lowering prices. Both scenarios are equally likely and the effects are equal and opposite. My argument comes from a respect of property rights. If I have ownership of something I should be allowed to do with it as I want. In the situation above if rents decline a renter is able to seek out a better deal and move. Landlords should be afforded the same right to seek out a better deal (tenant) if the markets permit it.Unfortunately I don't think we'll come to any sort of agreement as you've stated up front that you aren't taking into account property rights. If thats the case then you've simply made a judgement call that renters need to be protected and that their rights supersede those of others.

Economics	besttrousers	&gt; . In other words, there is little evidence that any tax cuts in he last 60 years actually reduced long term revenue. We averaged 18% revenue in the 60's, 18% in the 70's, 18% in the 80...well you get the idea.This isn't true. There's quite a [bit of variance](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=c7Y) over time.If you run the average you're sort of right:1950s - 17.31960s - 17.81970s - 17.91980s - 18.71990s - 19.12000s - 17.92010s - 16.8But that's largely an artifact. If you look at it by decades starting with years ending in 5 you see a clearer tendency to increase - 17.3, 18.0, 18.6, 18.6, 19.0.

self	YouAreNotAMonster	"To answer your original question: Yes, I believe your experience can affect your sexuality.  I had early male/male sexual experiences (though not with authority figures/adults), and although I found them pleasing, I also had an interest in girls.  Over time the repeated experience of being ""molested"" by big boys in the neighborhood eventually made me most comfortable being in the position.  It has taken a good bit of my life to work out that I can comfortably call myself gay.I tried female relationships but they never worked out.  My belief is that I was probably already pre-disposed to be gay, and that my early experiences just verified that.  Who knows whether I would have turned out straight if it didn't happen.As far as considering yourself a pedophile, that is likely based on your experiences combined with psychological issues that may or may not be related to your uncle's actions.  Most likely you are uncomfortable with adult relationships that could be as controlling and damaging as the one with your uncle, so you choose to prefer younger males over which you are the one who has control.  (This is sometimes referred to as the vicious cycle of abuse.)Although I was attracted to younger guys for a good bit of my youth, I eventually learned to control these desires and re-focus them in a positive way.  Notwithstanding any rationalization you may be able to develop, it is just NOT beneficial in any way to have sex with young teens or anyone younger, so apply your superior intelligence and avoid letting these situations happen.  Trust me, years from now, you'll be happy that you made the right choice.People in this thread should not be hating or giving ""death threats"".  The fact that you are reaching out and dealing with your feelings indicates that you are moving in a positive direction.  ""Pedophile"" is a broad and vague term.  It's not so much how you feel, but what you do that makes the difference.  If you have an interest in younger people, but do not act on it, you may be labeled a ""pedophile""; if you touch one inappropriately, then you are more properly label a ""child molester.""I can't tell how old you might be, but life if a process and you may very well evolve your feelings.Feel free to PM if you are interested."

Be afraid.)Likewise, spiritual practitioners in Hawai'i will very quickly send a patient to the hospital or their GP if it looks like something they aren't equipped to deal with.So long as the person is getting *appropriate* care, I only see this as beneficial.

I tend to keep it in program auto and just mess with the ISO, or switch to Av (aperture priority) or Tv (shutter priority) depending on the situation and the effect I'm trying to achieve. It's pretty rare that you need to manually control ISO, shutter speed, and aperture all at the same time.

You obviously have not used one of these phones. I have. They are incompatible. A western alternative would be Amazon's use of Android which does add to the numbers of Android despite it being incompatible with the android market. You're suggesting that there is reason to doubt that the widely used chinese variants and Amazon's variants are incompatible despite this is widely known. You can argue logistics about whether a completely incompatible Android should or should not be counted but you can't argue that they're not incompatible. While you're at it, you will have as much success arguing that a motorcycle is also a car because of their similarities.&gt;&gt;""China Mobile's OMS is therefore not only ""not Google,"" its also incompatible with Android apps""&gt;wtf? where's the evidence to support that assumption ?

Like OMS, Tapas is an Android competitor. Kai-Fu Lee, CEO of the company that creates Baidu the parent software from where Tapas originated said, “American companies often have a technology lead, as Google did. However Baidu evolved and became good enough.” He's right... it IS good enough to use though it is not android.You are right that Tapas OS, is derived from Android but it does absolutely nothing to benefit Google or other users of the Android platform. Tapas is ""modified to support"" as you suggest but that does NOT mean modified to support google marketplace. It's modified to support Chinese social networks, ebooks, video sites, search and other services that are not connected to Google.Here is a source that reinforces this: http://obront.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/oms-and-tapas-os-are-not-google-android/&gt;&gt;""Omit these very large 3 companies and the January numbers which again were already very close are now in iOSes favor.&gt;""citation? where are the numbers that you can so confidently deduce iOS come out on top. how can you do the math if you have no numbers?""[43% vs 47% source](http://www.osnews.com/story/25558/Reassessing_IOS_Android_and_Android-compatible_Market_Share)No source is reporting any other numbers other than these. These are the numbers that are reported. However as I've now shown you several times, these official numbers include the incompatible variants that Google does not recognize as being a part of Android.China's mobile phone market is VERY large... its [larger than the US for smart phone sales](http://www.wnd.com/markets/news/read/20035560/more_smartphones_now_sold_in_china_than_in_u.s.) and [Android in China is massive](http://phandroid.com/2012/04/14/chinese-android-market-share-doubles-in-2011-apple-stays-far-behind/). China Mobile's Ophone [is not the leader](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China_Business/LH24Cb01.html) in their market but their sheer size means they would have garnered some noteworthy share for their incompatible android variant.Tapas OS on the other hand isn't limited to a single company in China and is used by multiple suppliers. Remember what I said about China being the largest cell phone market.Lastly, Amazon uses an incompatible android variant however they won't say how many kindles the sold other than a [177 percent increase](http://www.laobserved.com/biz/2012/01/how_many_kindles_did.php) in holiday sales of all Kindles. Remember, kindle is the largest ""android"" (i use the term loosely as it is not REALLY an android) tablet provider.What's at play here for iOS to be the market share leader is only four percentage points. Not only is it not inconceivable but its downright likely that EACH of these represents as much as four percentage points.Even if they don't, simply removing a more conservative number such as 3 percentage points each does not simply remove those numbers from Android's total but increases iOSes numbers because we're not talking about specific numbers but percentage of a whole which changes the dynamic of both... iOS increases and Android decreases.&gt;""i've shared Android numbers showing Android is number one in the world, unless you hae EVIDENCE to show those numbers are false, then they stick.""You showed inflated numbers the include the incompatible non android versions. If you do that, make sure to also include Apple's nano music player's OS as well as Apple's AppleTV OS as both are based off iOS as well but they too are incompatible with the actual iOS just as the incompatible Android variants are also incompatible. After doing so, not only would it negate OPhone, TapasOS and Amazon's ""Android"" gains but iOS would likely be even more ahead.&gt;""SOURCE - Google's Android chief, Andy Rubin""I stand corrected. Google did say that.Let's analyze that number shall we? Using the compound interest formula, we can easily [calculate](http://www.mattrichman.net/post/14674366175/will-apple-outsell-every-android-vendor-combined-this) that Google activated 59,653,187 Android-based devices during Apple’s fourth calendar quarter.On Apple’s earnings call, Tim Cook told analysts that Apple sold over [62 million iOS devices](http://www.macworld.com/article/164979/2012/01/this_is_tim_apples_ceo_in_his_own_words.html) during the fourth quarter, which is about 4 percent more than all of the Android devices sold during the same time period.&gt;""850,000 new Android devices are activated each day""The number doesn't say that 850,000 were activate each day throughout all three quarters. The important number to analyze is the FINAL number reported at the END of a quarter. Its expected that a growing company will ramp up its sales numbers however it's disingenuous to assume that their highest numbers were consistently sold throughout that entire quarter. If anything its very telling that they don't say on that page how many they sold during the entire quarter as THAT is the number should be looking at.&gt;""got any sources for that, you keep mentioning that word. i do not think it means what you think it means...""Sources for what... that Nano's OS or that the android variants are incompatible.&gt;&gt;""An incompatible variant is an incompatible variant. It's easily seen.""&gt;""it can't be validated because there's no EVIDENCE to support the assertion.""Again, I assumed that you had SOME familiarity on this topic.

Software written for Android does not work for Tapas OS, OPhone or Amazon. The APIs are different because they specifically wanted a different and separate software ecosystem totally unrelated and ungoverned by Google ...THAT is why its incompatible. What's hard to understand about this?&gt;""just as Linux is Linux, regardless if it has Debian's packager, or Ubuntu's app-store, etc.""Linux is defined not by its packager or app-store but simply and solely by using the Linux kernel. Thats the point of linux. Applications written for an officially sanctioned linux will or can be run on all its derivatives. Not true with these android variants."

applehelp	raygan	I have seen many HDMI monitors without built in speakers that have a headphone jack or audio out. Does your monitor have anything like that? If so, you should just be able to hook up any speakers you like to it.If not, you'll have to investigate something to split the audio off from the HDMI before it reaches your TV. Not something I've seen before but perhaps there is an adapter for it somewhere. It would probably have to be a powered device, because HDMI is a digital signal and can't be simply split like an analog signal.

As per your link, there are hydrogen *compounds* that can condense -- ""ices"" like ammonia and water -- not molecular hydrogen. If there's a large enough ice/rock core, hydrogen gas can gravitationally accrete.

Canon is utilitarian and it works for professional use, but it could be better. The interface on the 5D Mark III I feels a bit obsolete considering the otherwise advanced camera. The physical interface of the camera is pretty much perfect as far as I'm concerned, and the addition of an optional servo toggle button was brilliant. That being said, the software is a bit clunky. I don't particularly like using joystick and wheel to scroll through options. The ""Q"" button is definitely on the right track, but it's far from perfect. A friend showed me a Sony camera recently that seemed to do that sort of thing much better. Overall, the interface on my 5D Mark III is far too similar to that on my Rebel XT. I think camera interface and functionality will continue to move towards that of a smart phone, and I am very excited for this. "

linuxquestions	Linuxllc	CALIBRATION       To give correct image quality, sheet fed scanners need to be calibrated       using the calibration sheet sold with the scanner. To  do  calibration,       you must insert this target in the feeder then start calibration either       by passing the --calibrate option to scan image or by  clicking  on  the       available  'calibrate'  button in the 'advanced options' in a graphical       front end. The result of the calibration is stored in a file in the home       directory  of  the  user  doing it.  If you plug the scanner in another       machine or use it with another account, calibration  will  have  to  be       redone.http://www.sane-project.org/man/sane-genesys.5.htmlTime to contact Canon for another calibration sheet.

Why? Because the blueray player is the bottleneck, it's too slow for reading during play - and having it spin up would slow down fast swapping of apps.  This means you don't need the game disc in the box to play the game.Well, if the disc isn't needed, how do you prevent people from just installing and then passing the game off to a friend?  You have the device check to see if the same disc has been installed on more than one machine, and then invalid the oldest installs.Pro Tip: the 360 does this already if you install your profile on two devices by recovering it on a second - it invalidates the oldest profiles as soon as they connect to the internet.

atheism	[deleted]	"I know I'll get downvoted to hell for this (as it were), but that's alright with me. First, OP, like all others here, I am so deeply saddened by your family's loss. No matter what your beliefs, no matter where anyone thinks loved ones go after death, we can all accept their immediate absence leaves a permanent void, which can be soothed but is never quite whole. As an atheist like you and your family, I've never given much thought to religious ideas such as heaven after leaving the Catholic church at 14. That doesn't mean people like you and I feel loss any differently than religious people. We know that, and most people in this thread know that, but the person(s) who left the note for you do not. Heaven seems to be their coping mechanism. They see eternal bliss after death as a way to ease the trauma that an absence is causing (think reciprocity), although we suffer, our loved ones no longer do. I think many theists and non-theists can both take comfort in that ideology that loved ones aren't suffering any more, though we may disagree on what exactly ""happens"" during that time. However, these people see Christianity and Jesus as the reasons for this comfort, and we do not. I think if the people didn't know you and your family that well, best case scenario, they thought you ""seemed"" Christian and were genuinely thinking this note would comfort you. Please do not be offended by ""seeming"" Christian, because if you did, in their minds it means you embodied the ideals they look for in ""good, Christian people,"" like kindness and love. It is a shame many religions do not believe these ideals can exist outside their own beliefs. And it is a shame that someone's (possibly) pure intentions resulted in further heartache. Please know that I agree, the letter was forward and presumptuous, and if they were indeed pushing an ""agenda"" then I believe their actions and decayed sense of morals will catch up to them. But if they meant well, truly, and saw you as one of ""them,"" even if that ideology is skewed, please try and find good in the simple act of human beings trying to do a kindness for one another. He was a beautiful person, I'm certain, and so lucky to have such a loving family like yours. Your fortune is kindness. It doesn't take a ceremony or belief in anything to have this. No one and nothing can take the warmth of your heart away, whether or not there exists a warmth of heaven above earth.My thoughts are with you and your family. No matter where your brother is, what we can be certain of now is the undying love he shared with you. That you have this ability to feel shows that you live, that you understand, and that you have passion. That you felt outrage at this signals your unbreakable loyalty to him. It comes through even in your sadness. Know that you are in the thoughts and hearts of many people, as is your brother's legacy. No matter where we will ultimately end up, here, now, we find a common bond in our support of you and your family."

technology	kaimason1	I had a friend who got suspended during finals week, fucking up the rest of his time in high school, because he put an arm up to block a punch. He had gotten into a fight with another friend (because that friend was being a douchebag to me due to a separate argument I had already tried to rectify, and friend A was trying to turn the situation around), who started wailing on him. Friend A did nothing because friend B was a weakling and friend A didn't want to get in trouble for fighting, but a punch went for his face as a security guard walked up as he blocked it, and the security guard thought he had thrown a punch too, and then it was the mostly innocent person's word against the word of the guy doing all the punching and the security guard who only saw the end of the fight from a weird angle. Zero tolerance is such a bullshit policy, self defense should not be discouraged, yet it is, and the timing of the suspension really fucked up friend A's academic career, while friend B's mom always got involved in every aspect of that friends life and thus he was back to school within like a day of her making hell for the school's administration / office staff.

Economics	gc3	Kudos to your success!I've been in the videogame industry... for over 20 years, and saw it change from a one person per project cowboy like development environment to large team efforts. Now I work at a company with huge teams, some of the largest in the business. The main reason for checklists in videogames is the prevention of bugs that prevent others in the team from working.  Here is my suggestion:  No systems allow too many mistakes. Poorly designed systems slow down the process too much and are too complicated to follow, so you need something between a tome of bureaucratic nonsense and nothing. One way to do that is to make sure that the checklists aren't set down from on high by an all-knowing manager, but are developed and tweaked by the people that have to use them. Knowledgeable experts can make suggestions, such as explaining why a certain step saves lives more than another, but it should be the staff who are ultimately responsible for developing, understanding, and implementing the checklist.This can result in different methods of operation in different sites: but since you are now tracking data you can find out which sites are doing a better job, and then try to get the ones that do a better job to evangelize their methods elsewhere, by taking videos of what they do as well as documenting what they do. (In some cases, I imagine, a video would work better... especially a video of an experienced person telling a less experienced person how to do the job)... people often leave things out when they explain things in documents.

books	amongwhales	This really connected with me.I love Herman Hesse. And had, perhaps, a similar experience with his work. I read Siddhartha when I spoke to some of my classmates who had read it for class. I was surprised that it was not centered purely around Buddhism and felt a lot of understanding from the novel. Then I continued with Demian and was very excited to see that his work shares many common themes. And that much of his work is very good.A copy of Steppenwolf is sitting on my shelf and now I really want to read it after hearing your shining praise.I have always been disappointed with reviews of Hesse or Siddhartha, that seem to label Siddhartha as his only work of note. From what I have read of his work, his biographical information, and synopses of his other novels, all of them seem very interesting.To anyone considering reading one of his novels, I hope you do. I think it will be very worthwhile. The novels are not too long, either, and a quick read.Now, to go get back the copy of Siddhartha that I lent to a friend so that I can do a re-read.

Economics	IncognitoIsBetter	"I hate it when Nobel laureates start talking politics."" The idea of bringing back debtors’ prisons may seem far-fetched, but it resonates with current talk of moral hazard and accountability. There is a fear that if Greece is allowed to restructure its debt, it will simply get itself into trouble again, as will others.""Apparently Stiglitz hasn't heard of Argentina. They've been bailed out several times by the IMF and the World Bank, just to have a populist government come in roll back on all reforms that helped to ease each crisis, go on massive subsidies, price controls, etc. and then fail again. And again, I feel people (specially economist) still confuse ""austerity"" with economic reform. In this piece Stiglitz keeps the ""austerity bad"" mantra, but suggests that there should be a bankruptcy option for sovereigns, just like personal bankruptcy... But in any reasonable case, a sovereign bankruptcy will look exactly how it does today, reforms and asset sales. Unless we're talking about a complete unlitareal wipe of the debt here, in which case would make emerging market debt extremely expensive for those countries and would inevitably force reforms or taking in massive internal debt that could lead to higher inflation.On the other side we have the stimulus gang calling victory after seeing the US spurt its way back into economic growth. But that neglects to mention than aside from a massive monetary stimulus, the US had little to no fiscal stimulus in these last 6 years. The ECB is already on the path of delivering massive monetary stimulus, so it seems the stimulus group are calling on Europe to go even further than the US and wants it to unload massive fiscal stimulus driven by government spending, something not yet proven. Furthermore, Japan has been delivering massive monetary stimulus for a while now, and it's still failing to spur growth... It's as though what worked for the US not necessarily will work for the rest of the world."

DoesAnybodyElse	fritopie	I found this out a little too late (during my second to last quarter before I graduated and moved the heck out of that small town).  Join a club or organization no matter how awkward it seems at first.  All you need to do is make one or two decent friends who will invite you places with other friends of theirs.  Or get a job and make a friend there.  Or better yet, participate in a study abroad type thing and meet people that way.  You are bound to make a friend or two when you travel with a group of people you don't really know(that's what I ended up doing, just wish I had been able to do it sooner).My last year of college was probably my favorite unfortunately.  It's the year I had a somewhat regular job and the year I did a 3 week study abroad thing in Paris.  Those two things allowed me to meet new people and get to know some people from my classes better, to the point where we would occasionally hang out after class.  My first year of college was somewhat miserable (although I do look back fondly on the endless hours spent in the darkroom... I sort of miss having an excuse to do that).  I was completely overloaded on classes for most of it, until I burnt myself out and began that downhill slide that lasted into the middle of my Sophomore year...Anywho, get involved with one thing, even if it seems sort of lame. And don't overload yourself on classes right off the bat, wait until you get the hang of things.  Don't slack off either... I had a roommate who did that...

This made me think about the rest if the software stack and weather or not it was as good as the open-source software that run on it. Once I discovered that any Linux distro I used on my aging laptop, actually made it usable, I quickly blew the windows partition away. Windows has a nasty habit of slowing down and never recovering even from a defrag. Linux does not need to defrag, that is not how the filesystem works! Android seems to suffer from this also. Oh and package management. How I ever managed all the new software I try out regularly I do not know. Btw, don't rely on the 'no AV' thing. If a machine can execute code, it can be used for malicious purposes. 
gamingnews	genericsn	Destiny so far has been the most addicting game I don't quite like. It's hard to explain since I love MMO's and FPS games, as well as Borderlands. It's just that the game captures major great elements from both genres, yet feels like it's lacking *something* like substance. I can't put my finger quite on it, but it feels hollow and empty. Writing and story is definitely a part of it, but it's not the whole issue. That being said, it really is a very, very fun game. It's got really solid gameplay. I'm really confused by how stats work out, but it's not like it gets in the way a whole lot. Maybe there's stuff in the manual, if there is one. I'm not sure. I just borrowed the disk from a friend in order to see if I want to actually buy it for myself.Maybe it's the hype, but it's still a great game that fails to fully satisfy me. Although all the mysterious future content really has me interested. Maybe everyone, including myself, will really change their minds after the first round of DLC comes out.

programming	sacundim	"&gt; UI is much better represented by immutable state IMO. Look at how well it works with React. Immutable allows you to determine if anything changed very cheaply (just a pointer comparison).I think the terminology here needs to change or evolve.  And sorry to pick on you, but you just said ""immutable state.""  :-PHere's one place where I think people go wrong in this conversation: they mistakenly equate **mutable cells** and **state**.  Mutable cells are the ""variables"" of imperative programs.  You can think of them as ""boxes"" that:1. Each one contains a value inside it;2. There's an operation to read the value;3. There's an operation to **replace** that value with a different one.One of the major themes of functional programming is to program just with values, without mutable cells.  But IMO it is an incorrect jump from there to say that ""functional programming is stateless.""  The recent reactive frameworks (which you bring up) are an excellent example of this—they're based on a programming model that both (a) pervasively embraces state, and yet (b) avoids the use of mutable cells.That's because we can model the *sequence of states* of a thing as a *value*, and work with these in terms of *pure functions*.  So for example if you have a slider in a UI, the sequence of states of the slider is a pure function of:1. The initial position of the slider.2. The sequence of states of the mouse and keyboard.The programmer is responsible for saying how the changing values that they are trying to construct depend on primitive changing values that the language provides (e.g., the position of the mouse and its buttons).  The language and libraries are responsible for propagating state changes across the system."

Because if you were to look back at the performance of a wheel, then you'd see that it happened previously, that is, even after millions of spins, a ""trend"" of 3 is far more likely to break than continue.Given that both wheels are of the same reliability, it can therefore be concluded that future spins (in the long run) will also conform to this rule.In the sessions I play, ordinarily short ones, the bets I place have either a flat 50% chance of a payout, (1:1 on my money) or a 67% chance of payout (3:2 on my money). Whilst I play, I see far more ""trends"" of 3 or 4 break, than carry on, considerably more than even 67%."

linuxquestions	sequentious	"There are really two options:1. Resize the partition, then use `pvresize` to resize the LVM physical volume to the size of the partition (if you omit any size parameter, it will fill the partition). Then use `lvresize` to resize the logical volume that is full (ex: ""-L +5G"" will add 5GB). Use resize2fs to resize the filesystem (omit any size, it will fill). Mucking with the partition is an exercise left for you. Have a backup.    # pvresize /dev/sdX    # lvresize -L +5G /dev/VOLGROUP/LOGVOL    # resize2fs /dev/VOLGROUP/LOGVOL2. Add a a new partition, use `pvcreate` to make it a new LVM physical volume. Use `vgextend` to add that physical volume to your LVM volume group. Then use `lvresize` to resize the logical volume that is full.    # pvcreate /dev/sdY    # vgextend VOLGROUP /dev/sdY    # lvresize -L +5G /dev/VOLGROUP/LOGVOL    # resize2fs /dev/VOLGROUP/LOGVOLThe second option is easiest, though some people prefer not to have the second partition. In reality, it doesn't really matter, as long as you've documented what you've done for those that come after you.**edit** also, since you're using LVM, you might actually have some reserve space left on the original 12GB pv. Use `pvs` to get a listing of all of your PVs and their allocated &amp; available space (you only have one, but it is a handy command).Other things you might need to know if you're not familiar with LVM (Read up on it though).`pvs` : list physical volumes`vgs` : list volume groups`lvs` : list logical volumesVolume groups are composed of one or more physical volumes (disks or partitions). They hold zero or more logical volumes (filesystems).Note that you can expand a filesystem while it is in use. As a matter of fact, the only thing that you would probably *not* want to be running the system during is the partitioning in option 1. Everything else can be done live.Again, have a backup."

In the end it feels like nothing but idiot strong men pounding their chests. Is this what people want to read? 2. The enemy is your long lost brother/sister! I feel this deserves a few words, though. I get that people like when the villain has a connection to the hero. In fact, this very trope was used in [Rucka's Batwoman](/spoiler) run, and it was good. It was also used in the first Dexter novel/season, and it was excellent there too. And it was used in [Snyder's Batman](/spoiler) and here I think it failed. The reason for that is that if suddenly the villain is your brother or whatever, that doesn't mean anyone cares. The reason it worked in my first two examples was because the book went into enough personal history to make that relationship important to the reader. EDIT: Can't believe I forgot fridging.

My mother went a bit insane on it and made my childhood hell. When you fail school because your parents are too reliant on illicit drugs than to buy you the essentials, something is wrong. I started smoking and found out first hand that I am one of the people susceptible to it causing mental issues. Thankfully I stopped before any serious harm was done. I don't understand why everytime someone brings up the 'pot is bad' argument pro cannibus supportors try justifying it with alcohol abuse being legal. Yes alcohol is bad for you but I believe from my personal experiences that pot is much much worse.

Christianity	danielpbarron	[God is love](http://www.atruechurch.info/godislove.html).&gt; Most people do not know love, because they do not know God (Psalm 10:4; 14:1-3; Matthew 7:13-14), and are therefore incapable of loving in any kind of godly way (Jeremiah 13:23; Romans 3:10-18; 14:23; Titus 3:3). God is the defining factor in a proper understanding of what is love, because God is love. If you do not know God (Galatians 4:8; 2 Thessalonians 1:8), you will not understand love, for the Lord is love. Therefore, if you do not understand (Ephesians 4:17-18), or you reject what is revealed in this report about God and love, it is indicative of your lost state (John 8:47; John 17:3; 1 John 4:6). May the Lord have mercy, and may you come to know the God of love.

What Lies Beneath was 13 years ago. His strength as an actor was always his relaxation and coolness. If you look at movies like Crystal Skull or Cowboys and Aliens he seemed stiff and forced. But maybe it was bad writing. I have a feeling if episode 7 stars these 3, it will never be able to meet a majority of fans expectations. It will be Crystal Skull all over again. But I suppose we have to put our trust in JJ Abrams.

business	ass_munch_reborn	&gt;  I don't see any problem per se with the first section.Exactly.  You asked for something that could be trimmed, and you never mentioned anything about trimming.  In fact, you summed it up (e.g. trimmed it for Reddit).You commented on the intent of the first part - and I got no problem with that.  No one is complaining about the intent of the law, they are complaining about the minute regulations. My complaint was about all the necessary details of the law.  You did not comment about signage, the length of the document, etc.If you went through every single item point by point and defended it, then it would be a different story.My complaint is that it could, and should be trimmed.  I think if you click the link, there are 30 other similar lengthy, legalese ridden parts for the state alone.  Let's compare this to something similar.  Look at a rental agreement in California.  They made a conscious effort to reduce the legalese, and you can sign for a lease in 30 minutes.  Now, if you are familiar with California rentals, it's notoriously pro-tenant.  But here's a lease:http://www.dca.ga.gov/housing/specialneeds/programs/documents/C-2SampleLEASE.pdfIn case you don't want to read it, the lease is about the length of in-room telephone rules.   That's what would spur innovation.Now, there are tons of laws to protect renters.  But the regulations keep the intent, but don't weigh down with the bureaucracy.  And, if are to look at all the laws, regulations, so forth.  If you rent your place as a hotel, it would probably take 40 hours and hundreds of dollars (signage, proper certs, etc.)My making the average AirBnBer do 40 hours of work before they can rent for one night, you're hurting the industry.  Now, if you rent, it's much easier.  Protections are still there, intent is still there, but needless mandated regulations to the nitty gritty details are not.  That is why the rental market is fluid and dynamic.

applehelp	sonymac	Mac Pros all use PCI Express.if you buy a non-Apple graphics card, you will most likely have to flash it as it won't work out of the box. If you're a newb, i wouldn't recommend taking this route as you can irreversibly damage your card if you don't know how to flash it.Flashing usually involves popping the card in a PC and running some commands to upload a hacked firmware file that adds Mac compatibility.There are forums at www.netkas.org and www.macrumors.com that have experts sharing information on how to do this and which cards can be flashed. I don't know if your particular card will work but an ATI Radeon HD 5770 can be had for as little as $80 to as much as $250 (for the Apple branded one). Of course, the Apple one will work out of the box and the cost premium reflects it.

food	PoliteGentleman	"Fast food is getting cheaper along with junk food. I was there visiting family during the World Cup and was surprised that at the restaurants I went to you were charged for a bottle of water instead of being given a free glass of water. It might have something to do with cleanliness, but my point was that the bottle of water was more expensive than a bottle or can of soda. Obviously I can't say that ALL restaurants are like this, but it was also prevalent when I visited a relative. Soda and juice were offered, but never water unless I asked. The juice option is also iffy because it passes for ""healthy"", but in reality is full of sugar. Also, lots of red meat and small amounts of vegetables. This was in Porto Alegre."

Economics	[deleted]	You are talking about a top down approach, which might allow for investment in efficient delivery and sourcing of water on the utilities end. However, when its done with market forces, such as allowing futures contract to raise the price early it extends to the entire market, such as encouraging homeowners to install more efficient toilets when they remodel, farmers to migrate to drip irrigation, industrial plants to opt for more water conserving chemical processes when they build new capacity etc... Doing it this way, you encourage efifciency that you might never have even considered, and the bonus is, you didn't introduce a new regulation that might have had an unintended consequence or otherwise increased the cost of regulatory compliance.

canada	Kaylaen	&gt; We need a referendum system to allow us to recall Prime Ministers. That way if any 38%-of-the-popular-vote PM gets delusional, he can be sacked.The leader of a party is elected by their own party members. A MP is elected by the constituents of their own riding. A Prime Minister is appointed for leading a party with the confidence of the house. I don't know how a recall would work for a Prime Minister.Would he lose his seat in the House thereby disenfranchising those that elected him? Does he lose his position as party leader, despite being elected by his own members? Why do non party members get to decide the direction of another's party? Do Conservatives get to band together to push Liberal, NDP, and Green party leaders out of their seats as well?Would, instead, Canadians be able to force an immediate dissolution of the House? How would *that* work? If the majority of our governments are decided upon by a minority of the population, do we get to just keep calling elections every time the results are not to our liking? We'd be in a never ending campaign mode and the functionality of our government at all would be crippled.The Prime Minister isn't a popularly elected leader. Removing him wouldn't stop anything. Another of Harper's members would step up to take his place. It wouldn't change our government. His party can already remove him. As can the GG or the Queen. As can the House if most vote in favour of a motion.The PM is not a president. He is not our head of state. He is not popularly elected. Short of getting rid of our parliamentary system I don't see how your idea would work at all. Our PM will never, and can never, be popularly elected.If the majority of Harper's political supporters didn't think he was doing a good job, he wouldn't be in power right now. The issues we're seeing are a result of 9 years of single-party rule. The area I'd be focused on is the potential reform of our terrible first past the post system, rather than blaming everything on one man. It takes more than one person to run a country.

What's more, I'll agree with you.But I do request that you remember the existence of a fine line between picking at how somebody uses certain words, &amp; contradicting the message they are conveying with said words.

It gets to be very personal it's a view point resonates with women but men have no frame of reference for. But you have Bill Burr up there talking about how he wants to adopt a child soldier and how he'd be terrified of the kid, it's not personal. It's a ridiculous bit that's hilarious. But it's universal. What Amy Schumer does is go that next step and presents her female view point but she's smart enough to communicate to the whole audience why something is funny, even if it is just her talking about a femalecentric issue.

In general, how could anyone have known in advance? And heck, what could anyone have done to stop it if they did know? These were people almost totally isolated from each other for thousands of years. Part of me wonders if the Europeans weren't lucky not to have suffered the exact same fate. Maybe they could have brought some awful disease back with them. It could have spread through Europe and maybe on into Asia. Maybe there could have been a global die-off, not just an American one.

canada	Renner1	"&gt; Just because you don't like the label applied to it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.I think it's a ridiculous label and it doesn't exist as it is because people don't ""like"" or condone rape. Rape is a felony and people who're convicted rapists aren't exactly looked highly upon, to say the least.&gt;  reporting rate of less than 20% of all sexual assaults on women says I'm right.Women not coming forward because they don't want anyone to ask them questions/don't have any evidence doesn't equal ""rape culture"".&gt; An annual estimate of 400,000+ sexual assaults on women nationally says I'm right.Estimates with an extremely broad range for what constitutes sexual assault. When third wavers try and pretend there were 400k rapes or attempted rapes-- well, it just gets harder to take them at all seriously.&gt;  success rate of less than 2% in the prosecution of sexual assaults cases says I'm rightRidiculous third waver ""talking point"". End of discussion on that one.Rape isn't a thousandth as common as they claim it to be and once again, hysterical hyperbole only makes it harder to believe them when they even remotely touch the subject.&gt; The fact you don't see the issue with the dress code and the motivations behind it says I'm right. The dress code is unisex. The fact that you don't see a problem in how Lauren Wiggins tried to ""address"" the issue shows that you're incapable of looking at things like this without screaming ""sexism"" or ""misogyny"".&gt; Your argument is invalid.Yours is absolutely ridiculous."

Android	potatos88	This may blow your little mind, but  Apple didn't need the brand boost by other companies to sell their product. They're not desperate like Google was. They use other companies to compliment services they do not have, and try to keep their influence to a minimum. Which is how all tech giants grow.It was obviously a move to integrate Nike's system into Apple's, considering Nike had already a head start in fitness tracking. That data would have helped boost the quality of the HealthKit system. The app disappeared as per contract, because Apple doesn't want to turn iOS into the carrier/OEM shitfight that plagues Android today.But turds like yourself wouldn't be looking at it that way, you're stuck with actual bloatware and you have to install a whole fucking OS in the place of what you get to escape it. Sucks to be you I guess.

worldnews	GhostedAccount	Liquidity is the difference between the number of buyers and sellers.HFTers cancel themselves out by being a buyer and seller of the same stock in a few milliseconds.  They don't hold onto anything.If there are more buyers than sellers, there is positive liquidity.  If there are more sellers than buyers, there is negative liquidity.I don't understand this concept that just because the trade count is doubled by HFTers, that liquidity was altered in any way.  How can it be when the whole point of HFTing is to get between existing transactions that would have happened anyways and never ever hold a stock for more than a few milliseconds.If you remove HFTing, the same number of buyers and sellers exists, the only difference is the buyer makes more profit, since the prices is not driven up by middle men doing HFTing.  And the seller gets the full payment of the buyer, not less than what the buyer paid.

atheism	S11008	"By natural reason, I'm simply meaning to say the reason that we are endowed with as we develop. Natural Theology is philosophical. &gt;basis in faith behind those assumptions does not disappear because the terms ""reason"" or ""rational knowledge"" are put to use.Which basis? Of course, we all start with very basic assumptions (the external world exists, logic works, induction works, I'm not a brain in a vat).&gt;I opened with an example of a scenario where someone could not determine which claim about a god was valid.It does not exist within a vacuum-- their background knowledge of God and their reasoning could both be used to differentiate between a true revelation and a false revelation. However, granted, there's a possible case in which someone's background knowledge of God, or their reason, isn't sufficient to differentiate the two. I submit that that is not a problem with _faith_, but with that person, who is lacking in these tools by either natural deficiency, accidental deficiency, or indolence. &gt;You go ahead and create your own example of an argument that makes a valid claim about an actual god's will plus all of the relevant supports that support that validity in comparison to contrary claims.I am saying the _opposite_, that revelation is by itself not an argument (non-rational, non-authoritative to others), nor should it be.

TwoXChromosomes	COCK_MURDER	"Actually I think the argument is pretty clear.The First Amendment states that ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech...""""The hypothetical statute we're talking about would prevent people from praising the body of a 15 year old girl, or asking her to chill in your car, which is a speech act.The government now attempts to enforce that law by prosecuting me (this, I think, is the link you're missing) for praising the body of a 15 year old girl, or asking her to chill in your car. The government CANNOT enforce that law, because that is a law, passed by Congress, which abridges the freedom of speech.All prosecutions are limited by the First Amendment. If there is a statute that says ""anyone worshiping Allah will be subject to a criminal fine""--that is an unenforceable statute rendered unenforceable because it would require the Court to violate the First Amendment's dictum that Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of religion. If there is a statute that says ""anyone found in possession of a gun of a certain kind shall be subject to criminal penalties""--let's call it the ""Firearm Control Regulations Act of 1975"" for shits and giggles--that statute (if you accept certain assumptions about the meaning of the Second Amendment that have nothing to do with the actor who passed that law or the actor who must now enforce it) is unenforceable because it would require the Court to violate the Second Amendment.Certainly not all speech is protected by the First Amendment. Some speech is not--child pornography, most notably. But unlike child pornography, which there are good public policy reasons to believe is not within the confines of the First Amendment, this is not obscene speech. If I want to go out tomorrow and let everyone know that a) I believe 15 year old girls should be able to have sex because ""age is just a number""--that's protected speech, b) I believe this 15 year old girl should be able to have sex because ""I can't get her off of my mind"" and I find her beautiful--that's protected speech. But actually propositioning her--that is NOT protected speech.I'll welcome an actual argument here because I think you have a misconception here about how constitutional claims are lodged, but it's hard for me to tease out the contours of your argument when you're just unnecessarily vitriolic. If you resort to profane indignation again, I'm not going to engage."

While there are downsides for everything, there's a lot of benefit to an open office plan when you are working in a collaborative or creative environment. Hearing what others are talking about, being able to catch someone coming back from a meeting and ask a quick face-to-face instead of doing it through email or having to drop in to their corner office, etc. are all really valuable in fast-moving industries.In my experience, there's a big difference in office dynamic when everyone has an individual office or high-walled cubicle vs. an open floorplan. I don't necessarily feel like that's a negative, and don't think it fits in with the other 'perks' that were outlined.

politics	Iamnotmybrain	&gt;A perfect example is Obama. All he has to do is not take funds directly from a registered lobbyist. He's never said he wouldn't take lobby money. Just not from a registered lobbyist. For someone who's supposedly knowledgeable in this industry, you display a remarkable naivete. Do you know how expensive, time consuming it would be to trace every single donation to its source? Not only that, but the reasoning for doing this makes no sense. The whole point of not taking money from lobbyists is to avoid the perception that lobbyists are buying influence. If the lobbyist cannot point to their contribution a a means of leverage, it's a useless donation for influence peddling. &gt;I don't see you listing your real name and the campaigns you worked in, either, by-the-way. Right, but I'm not basing my entire claim on anecdotal evidence. I'm not going into much depth about my experience because 1) it's not a good way to justify an opinion and 2) you have no proof that I'm truthful, just as I have none for you. You can scoff at the idea that you need to provide sources for your arguments, but that's a fundamental aspect of good argumentation. Yet, for something you allege to be incredibly common, you've provided absolutely nothing. &gt;With nice, big words, so we all know how purportedly educated you are.I'm sorry you think 'ascribe' and 'fabricated' are big words.

My husband's parents have both passed before we started dating.We found a nice local judge and got married in her tiny office with 4 friends. It was the right amount of stress for us. We included our mutual best friends responsible for introducing us and no family because our families are inequal in money and size. I have a sister, he has 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Only his family members would be able to afford to fly out for it, etc. I will admit that I am a little resentful from time to time for it. Because of the way we did it and being so separated from our friends and families there was no engagement party, no bachelor/bachelorette party, no wedding shower, and since we're never having kids I feel sometimes like I lost out on all those chances to have a special ME day. It seems so silly when I read what I put, but it is something I get sad about.

photography	UdonUdon	Software: Either Lightroom 3, Aperture, or Gimp with the UFRAW utility installed. Gimp is free (so is the utility), Aperture is around $75, and Lightroom 3 is around $200 but closer to $80 for people with student/teacher emails.In terms of function both LR3 and Aperture serve as a great photo organizer and RAW editor. Gimp + UFRAW is does not have a library function, but it edits pretty decently. Make sure you use a RAW editor that is *NON-DESTRUCTIVE!* That way you can always keep the original RAW file if you ever feel like doing something else with it. Gimp without the UFRAW patch is *not* non-destructive, but I believe non-UFRAW Gimp makes a TIFF copy for editing anyways.I only know how to use Lightroom, and found [froknowsphoto.com](http://froknowsphoto.com/category/lightroom/page/10/) a good place to start. I linked the oldest page of Lightroom tutorials as that is where most of the intro tutorials are found.

If the most successful, most lucrative and most well known brand decides to jump into search you better believe that Google has room to be nervous. I'll leave this here: http://www.computerworld.com/article/2490008/microsoft-windows/microsoft-gets-real--admits-its-device-share-is-just-14-.html

news	CBruce	"Absolutely, but then it's no longer one person and his family ""accidentally"" killed during a raid, it's a small army of civilians gunned down. Compare the coverage and backlash from Waco to any other random, no raid where someone gets shot.Undoubtedly, even our troops would fire on us. At least once. But would they continue to support open warfare on their fellow citizens, families, friends? And would there not be some kind of fallout for the administration in charge of such a fiasco?They backed off not because they didn't think they'd win, but because they were at risk of injury or death to some of their members *and* because they knew the fallout would only polarize and enrage far more people across the country. All over cattle grazing."

technology	[deleted]	&gt; Game theory continuously showed that collaborative games lead to higher gains for everyone. To win in this game as a consumer would mean to get the media and pay as low of a price as possible.Game theory (a branch of economics, nothing to do with video games) basically tells us this: if everyone thinks that everyone else will pay for something, nobody will pay. I don't have any studies on hand to link you to, but it's one of the fundamental principles of game economics and has been consistently proven through the world.&gt; Yes, if all expenses are covered for the duration of their work that should be considered fair. Everything else should be optional. People deciding to give them money to give them an incentive to make more awesome games, but it should be in form of voluntary payment to reflect the actual demands for the media in question.What is an expense? If a game designer buys a new car because he needs to get to work, is that an expense? What if he buys a porshe? What about a new TV? A new game system? A vacation? What is an expense exactly? Who counts it? Who decides?&gt; Yes, like everyone else currently does anyway. A person working in the office gets his/her hourly wage for sorting papers, crunching numbers and calling people, too. Also: What do you propose as an alternative?I'm really confused. If they make a great game that everyone wants, they should have to scrape by just like someone who makes a shitty game or works a shitty job? Why? What's their incentive to make a good game then?&gt; Fame, reputation, experience, contribution to society, personal wellbeing. What's a person's motivation other than that? Money is only an expression of exactly those incentives. Also: You using current economic models and management as a premise is more or less begging the question.Money is the only tangible expression of their incentives that they can use to live a comfortable life. Also: Me using economic models on a good is completely relevant and does not beg the question. That's how the economy works, dummy.&gt; Well, that's the risk they take... people aren't held responsible for bad business decisions anyway. BP gets ready to poison just another ecosystem. If you produce horrible content, then the possibility of going out of business should be your incentive to do better business next time so people are actually willing to support you.Yes, but by your design, if you produce great content, you still have to worry every second about going out of business. That makes no sense.&gt; Because it has no physical value.You do not understand economics. Things are valued on their market by demand. Demand is formed by more than physical use (value). They are valued relative to money and wealth. By your standards, a masterpiece movie has less value than a nail clipper.&gt; A piece of software is a mathematical equasion. Furthermore a piece of software is a non-physical good that has no inherent material value and can be copied and distributed freely at no additional cost to the original creator.A piece of software takes thousands of hours of contribution by many different people. It has the inherent value of labor and demand, which is where the value of all things are derived.&gt; I don't really see why you say people wouldn't be fairly compensated.Well, just one scenario: if they get their hourly wage and the production costs are vocered I don't see why they aren't properly compensated. What is your point?What's their hourly wage? 10 dollars an hour or 20? Who decides this?&gt; Because there is no valid reason why knowledge and information shouldn't be.This isn't knowledge or information, this is a product of somebody's labor.TLDR: What you are suggesting is impractical, reduces incentives to work, and for it to in any form succeed would have to completely go against everything we know and understand about economics. You have no idea what you are talking about and are seeking to justify piracy. Please, understand, one ought to be compensated for the fruit of their labor, in its entirety. To tell them otherwise is downright wrong.

tf2	LeopoldJackson	"Based on what you've said it seems like Spy could be a good class for you. First and foremost it's important to know the map you're playing on. (Specifically where enemies will come from, where to find the health and ammo on the map, and nice hiding places and routes that the enemy seldom use) This is paramount for the ""sneaking"" aspect of the Spy.In regards to helping your team and messing with the enemy, Spy is once again perfect. His sapper will disable any building. (Sentry guns won't shoot, Dispensers won't heal, teleporters won't...teleport.) So Spy is key to helping your team get past those ever annoying sentry guns. He was born for sabotage.Now for the accuracy. His only firearm is the Revolver which in itself is a fairly accurate weapon. Best used at close to medium range as the damage falloff is murder at long range. (Except for Sentry Guns. They do not experience falloff damage and you will inflict the maximum damage from any distance) A quick breakdown of the revolvers:**Revolver:** The Spy's default firearm. Packs quite a punch and remains fairly accurate. This is a great gun to start off with and practice with. Use this only if the enemy is at low health or chasing you.**The Ambassador:** This revolver does less damage than the stock Revolver and fires slower as well. The plus side is that shots to the head are a guaranteed Critical Hit. Might not be the gun for you starting out, considering you had shaky aim. It's great for assassinating unaware Engineers that are out of your reach.**L'Etranger:** This revolver is part of the Saharan Spy Set Bonus(Paired with ""Your Eternal Reward"" and the ""Familiar Fez"" your cloak and decloak noise volume is decreased at the expense if your cloak flickering for longer if you brush up against an enemy) The revolver itself does less damage than the stock revolver but fires at the same speed. With each hit to an enemy you regain some of your missing cloak. I like to call this the Pea Shooter as it does little as far as damage goes. Only use it if your cloak is low and you can kill the enemy you are about to engage. This weapon is best paired with The Dead Ringer or Cloak and Dagger.**The Enforcer:** This weapon does more damage than the stock revolver at the expense of .5 seconds of added time to cloak or decloak. This downside however doesn't seem to affect the Dead Ringer so you could very well consider it to be an upgrade from the Revolver if you're using the Dead Ringer to go along with it. In my opinion, this is the best revolver. It can kill Snipers, Spies, and Engineers(sans Gunslinger) in two shots up close. A very great tool to fend off enemies who are chasing you. Just remember that if you aren't using the DR with this gun, your best option is to kill your pursuer rather than cloak and run away(which takes forever)tl;dr The Spy would be a good candidate for what you're looking for, and there's a Spy tutorial in the game as well.

food	garmachi	&gt;According to the Maine Folklife Center, Native Americans originated bean hole beans by baking beans with bear grease and maple syrup in clay pots covered with deerskins and buried in coals in the ground.  The slow, long cooking makes the bean very digestible, tender and delicious.&gt;Maine logging-camp cooks modified this process, adds the Folklife Center.  The traditional bean hole is a stone-lined pit in which a fire is built until a good bed of coals forms.  A cast iron bean pot is lowered into the pit, covered with soil and allowed to cook, usually overnight. From here:  http://www.mofga.org/Default.aspx?tabid=659
