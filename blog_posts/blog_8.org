* Accuracy and Calibration Experiments:
  Here we report the results of runnning the baseline, DWAC, and ProtoDWAC on the IMDB
  and StackOverflow datasets. Following the procedure in the Card et al., we report
  Accuraccy (repeated experiments from Blog 7) and Calibration. We compare the results
  from Card et al..

  Similar to the findings in the previous blog post, we see that our proposed ProtoDWAC
  model achieves comperable accuracy and calibration on both datasets.

  | Baseline  |         0.905 |                  0.869 |
  | DWAC      |         0.904 |                  0.866 |
  | ProtoDWAC |         0.905 |                  0.867 |

* Interpretability Experiments
  In the Original DWAC model, we were able to interpret the model by looking at the nearest
  neighbors of each instance. Although are no longer using these distances directly
  in fueling our predictions, we are roughly achiving a similar effect by using our
  prototyped model. Here we show sone examples from the stackoverflow dataset of
  instances and their weights (calculated by using the gaussian kernel on l2 distance,
  same as how we determine the weight from each prototype). We include examples where
  the nearest neighbors are close, and where they aren't. Originals are selected from the
  test set, and nearest neighbors are found from the train set.

* Conformity Experiments
  [[[[../plots/blog_8_baseline_conf.pdf]]]]

* Next Steps
  Going forward, we're hoping to run a couple of experiments listed below

** Testing with Other Kernels
   Both ProtoDWAC and DWAC only use the gaussian and inverse polynomial kernels for determining
   weights from l2 distance in the embedded space. We're curious whether using something
   with a sharper tail would have noticable effects on the learned embedding space or
   robustness of the model. We intend on experimenting with something that assigns zero
   weight to far away examples. Note that using something like this was unsucessful in the original
   DWAC work. We hypothesize that this is because of the limitations of batch size in the DWAC
   work since the requirement goes from having at least 2 examples of each class in a batch
   to having at least 2 examples of each class within a given proximity. We're also interested in
   allowing the model to learn variances or associated weights for each prototype corresponding
   to its relative strength of neighborhood.

** Using Training instances as Prototypes:
   We're interested in whether we can use learned prototypes to later select training examples
   to act as our prototypes, or if we can use some other method of selecting training
   instances as prototypes directly before training starts. One possible avenue for exploration
   is determinantal point processes from Kulesza and Taskar.
