## Summary of the group feedback discussion

### Things we did well on:
* communication was great and effective
* succesfully executed most ideas we had
* forstered a positive and cohensive group dynamic

### Things we can improve on:
* we want to have a better organization and planning to improve the efficiency
* we need to brainstorm and explore new methods to improve our models
* we want to find better ways to share responsability and divide work farly

### In future weeks, we decide to:
* schedule group meetings twice a week
* make consensus on several goals that we want to achieve each week
* clearly distribute the work so we could work on our parts parallelly
