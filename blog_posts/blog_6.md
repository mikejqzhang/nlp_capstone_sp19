## Dataset and Direction
In our past blog posts we have been focusing on the task of classifying potentially previously unseen communities (subreddits) 
on a  dataset made up of comments from the social media site Reddit. At the same time we have been trying to gauge the
effectiveness of modifying the DWAC model (discussed in more length in previous blog posts) to better leverage prototype
embeddings for classification. However, the Reddit task has proven to be too difficult to really gain any meaningful insight
from (our models struggled to get to 5% accuracy). Therefore, we have decided to temporarily move away from the Reddit data
and test our model on easier, more standardized datasets. To be clear, we are not giving up on Reddit, rather we are 
acknowledging that we need to put more work into understanding, and potentially denoising the dataset before we can get
meaningful results.
